            body: "PokePucks is a game of collecting, trading, and staking Pokemon themed 'pucks'. While it can be enjoyed as small individual games called \"Battles\", it can also be played as an \"Adventure\", where players track their progress using collected pucks to traverse the Pokemon world and compete for goals such as collecting all available Pokemon Slammers or Gym Badges. While there are many nuances to the game, the core of the experience is to stack up some pucks and throw a slammer at them, collecting the pucks that land face up."

            header: "What is a Puck?",
            body: "A puck is a flat disc about an inch and half across and about a 16th of an inch thick. Historically, pucks were first known as \"milkcaps\", because they were a collection of paper lids from glass milk and juice bottles in Hawaii during the Great Depression. They are better known by their 1990's trademarked name, \"Pogs\", a name derived from the \"Passion Fruit, Orange, and Guava\" bottles they were originally collected from. Many times several milkcaps were glued together to make a \"kini\", or a thicker, plastic pog was made to be a \"slammer\". Though milkcaps/pogs have always been made from paper, Pokepucks utilize the exciting world of 3D printing and computerized drafting to create new and unique pucks."

            body: "You want to build a collection of 9 or more pucks, one of which should be or be used as a slammer. Though any puck would count, some pucks are specifically Pokemon-themed. These are called PokePucks, or in the case of slammers, Pokeball Slammers and Pokemon Slammers. You will also need a friend with at least 9 or more pucks. If it is your first time playing, it is recommended that you play a Training Battle with no modified rules. After you understand the core gameplay setup and loop, start adding in rules such as puck abilities and slammer abilities."

            header: "Rules Explanation",
            body: "The rules for both the \"Adventure\" and \"Battles\" are written as \"Game Modes\" consisting of a Setup, Loop, and End Stages, General Rules, and Modifiers.\n In the Setup Stage, players involved will make several decisions about what game they want to play and begin putting the pieces in place. It's important that everyone agrees to the experience they want to have beforehand, else they may not have fun.\nIn the Loop Stage, players take turns going through a series of steps, called \"phases\", until only one player can take their turn, or another agreed upon condition is met.\nIn the End Stage, players decide who won the match, and how to distribute the pucks used in the game.\nGeneral Rules are rules that are always in effect at any Stage of the Game Mode. Modifiers are used in Game Modes that copy the base Setup and Loop from another Game Mode, and overwrite them with new rules. For example, an Even Ante Battle has all of the same rules as an Ante Battle, except there are a few rules changed so that both players leave the game with the same number of pucks as when they started."

            header: "A Note About Staking",
            body: "Dating back 100 years, a big part of the fun of pucks has been staking. In a small group of friends, it is an exciting way to trade extra pucks you had with others. In some game modes, your opponent will keep some of pucks from the game, even if they are yours! Some refer to this as gambling, but it is not. While some factors seem random, your own personal skill, and how you strategically use rules and abilities in the game allow you to control the outcome of the game.\nHowever, it can feel very bad losing a lot of your favorite pucks. It's important to agree what kind of game you want to play with your opponent before the game starts. There are game modes that do not involve staking, and game modes that split the pogs in a fair manner after the game. Once you put a puck into a game, it isn't your puck anymore. **Never play a game with a puck, a number of pucks, or a slammer that you want to keep.**"
