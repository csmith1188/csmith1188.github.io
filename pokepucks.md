Battle Rules
Battle rules are always in effect, but are always overridden by other core rules and special rules.
1.	Players may not touch the Arena Stack if they are not the current player.
2.	Players may not touch the pucks in other player’s Health, Power, or Prize stack without that player’s permission.
3.	Players may not discard pucks (move pucks to your Prize Stack) at will.
4.	Players may not use the special rules of more than 1 of the same Item Puck in a single turn.
5.	Players may not use special rules of pucks in a Prize stack.

Battle Loop
Players take turns in their turn order until all but one player has been eliminated! The bold text below are the simplified core rules, normal text are the smaller steps to take in that core rule, and italicized text are designer’s comments about the rules to help explain them.
1.	The current player tops-off the Arena Stack.
If the previous player did well and picked up a lot of pucks, they have “damaged” your slammer by forcing you to top-off more pucks from your Health stack.
2.	If the current player has the Critical Status, the previous player may attempt a Knock Out.
a.	Set aside the pucks in the Arena stack, and move the current player’s slammer into the Arena stack.
Just like the classic Japanese game of Menko, it’s your slammer against theirs!
b.	The previous player makes an attack. If the current player’s slammer is flipped, do not pick up; the current player is out of the battle. Move their slammer and all of the pucks in their Health, Power, and Prize stacks to their collection. Skip to the end of this turn.
If you can flip their slammer, you knock them out of the game!
3.	The current player counts the number of attacks they can make.
a.	The current player gets 1 attack.
b.	Modifications to the number of attacks from special rules would happen after this.
c.	If the current player’s slammer has a Power Type matching the Weakness Type of the the next player’s slammer, increase the number of attacks by 1.
d.	If the current player’s slammer has a Power Type matching the Resistance Type of the next player’s slammer, decrease the number of attacks by 1, to a minimum of 1.
4.	The current player makes all of their attacks.
a.	The current player makes a throw by physically throwing their slammer at the Arena stack. If slammer does not hit by touching the top puck of the Arena stack after it has left their hand, the attack ends.
b.	Count the number of pucks the current player can pick up, which is the number all flipped pucks inside of the arena. A flipped puck is a puck that lands face up inside of the arena.
Many special rules change the number of pucks you can pick up.
c.	Pick up that number of pucks by moving them to the current player’s Power stack,
d.	The current player restacks the pucks that were not picked up. The pucks that are closest to the center of the arena go on the bottom of the Arena stack, whereas the ones furthest away go on top. The current player may then put any pucks that landed outside of the arena on top of the Arena stack in any order.
5.	The current player may discard any pucks in their Power Stack.
Some special rules only apply if there aren’t any of a certain type of puck in your Power stack. Now is your chance to get rid of the pucks that aren’t helping you.
6.	If the current player is the only player still in the battle, they are the winner.
a.	Move the pucks from the Arena Stack into their Prize Stack. Move their slammer and all of the pucks in their Health, Power, and Prize stacks to their collection. They are then out of the battle.
 
Training Battles
In a training battle, players are be able to practice battling without the risk of losing any of their pucks. For simple games, play with only Sandbag pucks and Pokéball slammers, or suitable proxies for them. For a fair match with a challenge, use a premade collection that has a variety of items and trainers.
Starting a Training Battle
This is the same as a battle, except:
1.	All legal pucks must be from the same collection, which none of the players own, the players share, or the players decide which collections they will go to when the battle is finished.
In other words, use a community box of pucks, or each player uses pucks they can easily identify as theirs so they can get them back after the battle.
2.	Players may still select a slammer from their collection if the other players agree.
If the players agree, they can also bring their favorite Pokémon slammers so they can test their special rules and type matchups.
Training Battle Loop
This is the same as a battle, except:
1.	Replace all instances of “your/their collection” with “the collection”.
Put the pucks back into the community box or the collection of the player who owns them.
Wild Battles
Wild battles are high stakes, with slammers on the line. Every round is a potential knock out, pitting Pokémon directly against each other, with only a few items to support them.
Starting a Wild Battle
This is the same as a battle, except:
1.	Players may not move pucks to their Health Stack.
This will always force the slammers into Critical State
2.	When players move slammers from their collection to their Power stack, they instead may only move up to 1 Pokéball slammer to their Power stack.
Be sure to bring plenty of Switch pucks to bring out your Pokéball and catch the opponent’s slammer!
3.	When players would move pucks from their Health stack to their Prize Stack, they instead move up to 5 pucks from their collection to their Power Stack.
Once a puck has been used as a shield, nobody will be able to use its special rules anymore.
Wild Battle Loop
This is the same as a battle, except:
1.	When attempting a Knock Out, before making the attack, the current player may move any number of pucks from their Power Stack on top of their slammer in the Arena stack.
You can risk the pucks that power you up create a shield over your slammer, making it harder to flip.
2.	After attempting a Knock Out, move all pucks that were not picked up to the current player’s Power stack.
If your opponent doesn’t flip the pucks you used as a shield, you get them back.
3.	If a special rule would move a puck to a player’s Health or Power stacks, or a player would pick up a puck, instead move it to their Prize stack.
There’s no healing or picking up in a Wild battle Your slammer should always be in a Critical status.
4.	The Critical Status does not have a special rule.
You can gain other status effects, and the Arena stack cannot be topped off anyways…
5.	All Pokéball slammers are considered to be Wild Pokéballs in addition to their PuckDex entry.
According to the Slammer Special Rules table, players can steal opponent’s slammers with a Pokéball!  
Status Effects
Many special rules in the game will cause your slammer to gain or lose statuses. These represent the battle state of your Pokémon with recurring special rule to apply when using your slammer. 
Statuses are applied to the puck that you are currently using as your slammer. Therefore, if you switch your slammer for a new puck, the new puck gains the Statuses and the old puck loses them. When your slammer has one of the following Statuses, apply the special rules below.
Critical	Your slammer cannot gain other Statuses. During the next player’s turn, treat the Arena stack’s max size as being half its normal size.

Paralyzed	After determining the number of attacks you can make, reduce the number of attacks by 1, to a minimum of 1.

Sleep	After determining the number of attacks you can make, reduce the number of attacks to 1. If you flip any pucks in your turn, do not pick up. Instead, your slammer loses Sleep status.

Poisoned	When you top-off, treat the Arena stack’s max size as being 1 more.

Confused	After you make your last throw on your turn, if you do not pick up any pucks, you are considered to be the current player during the next player’s top-off.
